Based on LCDial written by Wolfgang Pichler (wp@commoveo.com)


Rev. 16.0 2019-02-03
	Added support for Asterisk 16
		- using ast_malloc() instead of malloc()
		- using ast_free() instead of free()

Rev. 14.0 2017-06-08
	Added support for Asterisk 14

772 
	Added support for Asterisk 1.8

771 -  (for asterisk 1.6)
	If dialstatus == "BUSY" then will try the next trunk because
	some ATAs returns BUSY instead of CONGESTION

770 - 2009-12-21 (for asterisk 1.6)
	Now it's possible to configure asterisk to route outgoing calls in different
	ways through the first parameter passed to LCDial.
	
	NOTE: LCDial() is changed so a new argument is added (the first one). The
	tables lcdial_providers and lcdial_rates remains the same of the previous
	version!

	Syntax: LCDial(path_number,called_number,dial_options)
	LCDial(1,0123456789,30,m) route call through the providers where enable=1
	LCDial(2,0123456789,30,m) route call through the providers where enable=2
	
	This feature is useful for PBX used by more than one company, so you can
	define that users 11,12,13,14,15 calls through the providers where the
	"enabled"	field (in providers table) is 1, while users 51,52,53,54 calls 
	through the	providers where "enabled" field is 2.
	This can be done for up to 10 routes, between 1 and 9.
	If the first parameter is not specified, 1 is assumed.

	Example: extensions.conf
	; define which users uses the 2nd path
	LCDIAL_PATH_2=51,52,53,54
	;LCDIAL_PATH_3=61,62,63

	[macro-LCDialSetPath]
	; set the variable "LCDialPath" (first argument of LCDial) to select
	; the path for the outgoing call
	exten => s,1,Set(LCDialPath=1)
	;exten => s,n,MacroExit
	; select the path
	exten => s,n,GotoIf($["a${LCDIAL_PATH_2}"="a"]?:20) 
	; LCDIAL_PATH_2 exists:	check that the extension that originate the call is inside LCDIAL_PATH_2
	exten => s,n,MacroExit
	exten => s,20,GotoIf(${REGEX("${CALLERID(number)}" ${LCDIAL_PATH_2})}?:40)
	exten => s,n,Set(LCDialPath=2)
	exten => s,n,MacroExit
	exten => s,20,GotoIf(${REGEX("${CALLERID(number)}" ${LCDIAL_PATH_3})}?:60)
	exten => s,n,Set(LCDialPath=3)
	exten => s,n,MacroExit
	exten => 60,MacroExit

	[trunknational]
	; National context accessed through trunk
	exten => _0ZXXX.,1,NoOp(National outcall)
	exten => _0ZXXX.,n,Macro(LCDialSetPath)	; set the path to call to (enable=1	or enable=2 or...)
	exten => _0ZXXX.,n,LCDial(${LCDialPath},${EXTEN},90)
	exten => _0ZXXX.,n,Hangup

769 - 2009-12-08 (for asterisk 1.6)
	Only sample data was changed (lcdial_providers and lcdial_rates)

768 - 2009-04-30 (for asterisk 1.6)
	Information about selected provider (for outgoing calls) now are
	written to the log system with NOTICE level instead of WARNING.

	New table structure:
	1. create new field "ratename" into lcdial_providers, to permit creating
	more providers (each one with its dialstring) with the same tariff
	2. create new field "ratemul" into lcdial_providers to assign a multiply
	factor for the rates: this permit for two or more providers with the same
	ratename to have a priority while selection
	3. removed timeout in the dialstring

	Also, created 2 scripts to import justvoip and eutelia rates automatically 

767 - 2008-12-12
	Some changes from Sebastian Gutierrez to port sources to asterisk 1.6

766 - 2008-09-14
	Added the 'U' option which permit to make only one attempt to call, using
	the best provider.
	Note: the 'U' character should be the first one, for example
	LCDial(number|Um)
	This options should not passed to the Dial() application, but will be filtered.


765 - 2008-08-04
	Revised several things to permit the clean compilation with asterisk 1.4.21
	The functionality remains the same of the previous version.

764 - 2006-11-03
Few modifications by Paolo Subiaco (psubiaco@creasol.it):
	* modified database structure: only two tables now are used, one to define
		the list of providers (and corresponding dialstring and enable/disable
		flag), and one with the list of prefix/rates associated to every provider

	* prefix field is now a regular expression which permit to specify a group
	of profixes (like ^00(39|43|34) or ^00393[23469]) but be careful about the
	length of the prefix, used to see which rules match first

	* the query specified in lcdial.conf file extract from the database the list
	of providers (there can be more than one rule/provider) that match the
	dialed number ordered by prefix length; then, the lcdial application will
	take from this list only one rule/provider (the first one) and sort this
	rules by rate to first call through the best rate provider, then the 2nd
	one, and so on...
